# To install a specific version of the web3 library in Python, you can use pip, Python's package manager. Here's how to install version 6.15.1 of web3:

pip install web3==6.15.1

# This command will install web3 version 6.15.1 and its dependencies. After installation, you can use web3 in your Python projects by importing it:

import web3

# Make sure you have pip installed, which usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not, you can install it using your package manager or by following the official documentation: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

# To check the version of the web3 library installed in your Python environment, you can use pip itself. Here's how:

pip show web3
